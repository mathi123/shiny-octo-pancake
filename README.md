# Why

This repository is a collection of modern web development tools aimed at creating fast, robust, and future-proof applications. These applications are designed to handle complex business domains, utilizing a domain-driven approach and setup to ensure scalability and maintainability. This repository is about:

- Using minimal and well-known libraries
- Writing clean code is a domain driven approach
- Well tested with unit tests and e2e tests

# Quickstart

To get started, you need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathi123/neurotic-web.git
cd neurotic-web
pnpm i
pnpm db:start
pnpm db:migrate
```

And to start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

# Technologies

## Next.js

Next.js was installed using [manual install](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation#manual-installation) procedure. This contains a section on [TypeScript setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation#ide-plugin) in VS Code.

## TypeScript

The tsconfig file contains settings for compiling TypeScript. The following settings were modified:

- allowJs: set to false
- strict: set to true

In order for @/... imports to work, the following config was added:

```json
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["app/*"]
    }
```

## Commit message

Commit messages must use the [Conventional Commits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) config.

## Linting

ESLint was set up to use 3 rule sets:

- Next.js rules
- TypeScript rules
- Prettier rules (such that they don't conflict)

## Formatting

Prettier is used to automatically format code.

## Node Version

The Node.js version is indicated in .npmrc, and the pnpm version in package.json. These versions are also used on CI/CD. Be careful to run commands with pnpm, not your local npm version.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Vitest is used for running unit tests.

```bash

pnpm run test
# Or with code coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

```

## Database

### ORM

Prisma is used as an ORM. Modify the schema.prisma file, and add a migration as follows:

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate
```

Notes:

- Neon Adapter is used on production and Pg Adapter for local development
- To check: [connection pooling](https://vercel.com/guides/connection-pooling-with-functions) still relevant with Neon driver?

## Known Issues

### Turbopack

TurboPack and @prisma/pg-adapter don't work well together, for pnpm. The following error is thrown when instantiating the adapter.

```bash
Package pg can't be external
The request pg matches serverExternalPackages (or the default list).
The request could not be resolved by Node.js from the project directory.
Packages that should be external need to be installed in the project directory, so they can be resolved from the output files.
Try to install it into the project directory by running npm install pg from the project directory.
```

A temporary fix was to modify the .npmrc file as mentioned [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/76247).

```.npmrc
public-hoist-pattern[]=*pg*
```
